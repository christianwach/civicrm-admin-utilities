Utilities for customising CiviCRM's behaviour and appearance in single site and multisite installs.

### Description

Please note: this is the development repository for *CiviCRM Admin Utilities*. It can be found in [the WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/civicrm-admin-utilities/), which is the best place to get it from if you're not a developer.

*CiviCRM Admin Utilities* is a WordPress plugin that modifies CiviCRM's behaviour in single site and multisite installs. It does a number of useful things:

* Supplies a theme for CiviCRM admin screens that is more in keeping with WordPress (see below)
* Modifies the styling of the CiviCRM menu to fix a number of issues
* Fixes the appearance of the Shoreditch extension in WordPress admin
* Fixes the appearance of the WordPress Access Control form where necessary
* Offers options to prevent various CiviCRM Stylesheets from loading on the front-end
* Adds a handy CiviCRM Shortcuts menu to the WordPress Admin Bar
* Allows you to choose which Post Types the CiviCRM shortcode button appears on
* In WordPress multisite, allows you to hide CiviCRM on sub-sites
* Allows you to remove "administer CiviCRM" capabilities from sub-site administrators
* Allows suppression of the "change of email" notification when a CiviCRM Contact's primary email is changed
* Gives an overview of the relationships between Users and Contacts via the "Manage Users" screen

### CiviCRM Admin Theme

Version 0.5 introduces a new theme for CiviCRM admin screens that is more in keeping with WordPress. It can be enabled on the CiviCRM Admin Utilities settings page. Feedback is welcome - please [open an issue](https://github.com/christianwach/civicrm-admin-utilities/issues) if you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements.

### Notes

This plugin requires a minimum of *WordPress 4.9* and *CiviCRM 5.39* but recommends you keep up to date with both.

If you have installed the Shoreditch extension for CiviCRM, then this plugin does its best to make it compatible with WordPress. Unfortunately, Shoreditch version 0.1-alpha25 now makes it very difficult to override the margin applied to the body tag on the front end of your site, so you will have to do this yourself. See [this PR for details](https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.shoreditch/pull/291).

### Installation

There are two ways to install from GitHub:

#### ZIP Download

If you have downloaded *CiviCRM Admin Utilities* as a ZIP file from the GitHub repository, do the following to install and activate the plugin:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the plugin's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/plugins/civicrm-admin-utilities`
2. Activate the plugin (in multisite, network activate)
3. You are done!

#### git clone

If you have cloned the code from GitHub, it is assumed that you know what you're doing.

### Setup

In single-site installs, you can adjust this plugin's settings by visiting "Settings" --> "CiviCRM Admin Utilities". If you install this plugin in multisite, you'll find its network settings page at "Network Admin" --> "Settings" --> "CiviCRM Admin Utilities". If you have CiviCRM network-enabled, then you should also network-enable this plugin.

### Upgrading from 0.3.3 or earlier

If you have this plugin installed on WordPress Multisite and this plugin is *not* network activated, then read on.

Prior to version 0.3.4, this plugin stored its settings in the *network options* rather than in the *site's options*. This meant that separate sites *shared* their settings rather than being individually configurable. Version 0.3.4 changed the location where the plugin's settings are stored to be appropriate to the install location and, as a result, each site can be configured differently.

If you are upgrading from 0.3.3, therefore, you may need to review the settings for each site where *CiviCRM Admin Utilities* is activated.

Version 0.6 introduces further changes to configuration in WordPress Multisite which you should be aware of. When the plugin is activated on any site on the network, Network Administrators will then have access to a Settings Page in WordPress Network Admin at "Network Admin" --> "Settings" --> "CiviCRM Admin Utilities". This means that there are settings at both the site level and the network level.

Network Administrators can now set site defaults for any further activations of this plugin across the network. There are also network-specific settings that can be set. Of particular note are new permissions settings which allow you to remove "administer CiviCRM" capabilities from individual site administrators if that's how you want to configure your network.
